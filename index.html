                    <h3>How I learned to Weld & Solder</h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my entire childhood I was always involved in STEM based competitions. Sometimes
                        Science Fair, other times Solar Car and MATE ROV, in these it quickly became essential that I knew 
                        how to solder. The extent of the teaching I received was telling me not to eat the solder and not to 
                        touch the soldering iron tip. After this in depth introduction I was tasked with repairing everything, 
                        from loose wires to circuit boards I did it all. Over time, I've learned how to delicately apply solder 
                        and how to trouble shoot any errors that may occur. 
                        <br><br>
                        Welding is a bit of a shorter story. My first experience welding came when my robotics teacher taught me about friction
                        welding. When people hear the word "welding" most people think of combining two metals. However, you can also combine 
                        other materials such as plastic. One specific type of plastic that I used commonly was PLA, by spinning it using a 
                        dremmel tool I could liquify it and join together PLA parts. 
                        <br><br>
                        After becoming proficient in this I moved onto welding metals as well. The image on the left is a little deceiving, 
                        I am actually using a gas torch to cut through a plate of iron, I chose to show this because the photos are significantly 
                        better and because you can't see much when someone is actually welding. I learned the basics of how to do two types of 
                        welding, stick and MIG. Both had a steap learning curve and several times I was left with my tip stuck in the metal. 
                        After a couple minutes of practice in each I was able to make some clean dimes!

                    <h3>Utilizing 3d Printing & Modeling</h3>
                    <p>
                        3d printing and modeling are two skills that I also learned in school. I've worked with several modeling softwares, but
                        what I gravitate to most is Fusion360. Fusion 360 is a software which is owned by Autodesk and has many quality of life 
                        features that make modeling significantly easier, as well as faster, to do. 
                        <br><br>
                        Another software that I use both personally and in school activities is Ultimaker Cura. Its ease of use with the different
                        types of supports, various features for build plate adhesion, and automated responses that I can't find in other slicers.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally we get to the actual printing and uses of 3d technologies. I primarily use an Ender 3 v3 and a Prusa mk4 which can
                        print essentially anything that I want. I have used both of these to design parts for technology competitions as well as 
                        for my own personal use. Generally when using printed items you need to maintain an awareness of which direction it was 
                        printed on for two reasons. The first being material consumption, often times to make more intricate components supports 
                        are needed. If positioned improperly, additional material may be needed which could otherwise have been concerved for future
                        projects. The second concideration is the build direction of the component. Depending on how it is printed the part will sheer
                        more easily in one direction than another.

                    <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                        At first, coding did not come easy for my. C++ was forced onto me made absolutely no sense and I felt that I was just going through
                        the motions without any real understanding. Then I took a class in Python which allowed me to truly understand the basics of programming
                        and from which I gained my passion for it. 
                        <br><br>
                        Since then I have taken other classes across many other languages, each with its own unique quirks. Soon enough, I wanted to know 
                        more than what school could offer. So I watched videos, and took courses like the one I am currently using, The Odin Project.
